## weakness of previous study

High-level features learned from a dataset like the ImageNet doesn't align well with abstract features in a industrial setting.

## Patch's strategy

divide the image into patches

Using mid-level features and aggregate features from its local neighbor.

**SPADE:** store multi-layer features of the pretrained network.

**PaDiM:** Using more statistc methods. It calculated the mean and variance of the features. And using Mahalonious Distance to detect the anomaly.
